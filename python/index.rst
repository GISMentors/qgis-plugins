QGIS and Python
***************
          
From QGIS 0.9, we can use Python programming language. Through that, we have access to some functions that combine Python and QGIS. 

These functions can be used in these situations:

* Creating an automated script that starts on launch of QGIS
* Use of interactive console and direct commands
* Creating and using custom plugins
* Creating custom applications built on QGIS libraries

We can also create plugins for QGIS server.
